As it currently stands, OpenCore is future of hackintosh going forward. However, Clover offers more stability. If you wish to install macOS with ease on this hardware, you should remain on Mojave 10.14 when using my EFI as reference. I have had zero complications or instability.

In the near future I will upload an OpenCore based EFI. It is currently in the works.
