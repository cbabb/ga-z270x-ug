As it currently stands, OpenCore is future of hackintosh going forward. However, Clover offers more stability. If you wish to install macOS without fear of boot troubles, you should remain on Clover.

Clover: Please [follow the guide here](https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/) if you need details or information explaining the sections of the config. These configs are unchanged since I last used them. I have had zero complications or instability. I have left them available as a reference for this motherboard. You can esentially drop in place and go.

OpenCore: I have not had any issues thus far. If you want to take a dive, go for it. The guide for [OpenCore can be found here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/).
