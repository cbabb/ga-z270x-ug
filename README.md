As it currently stands, OpenCore is future of hackintosh going forward. However, Clover offers more stability. I do not plan on migrating to OpenCore on this hardware until it reaches are more stable level. If if you wish to install macOS with ease on this hardware, you should remain on Mojave 10.14 when using my EFI as reference. I have had zero complications or instability. Which is why the repo has yet to be updated.
