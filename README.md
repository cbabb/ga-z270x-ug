As it currently stands, OpenCore is future of hackintosh going forward. However, Clover offers more stability. If you wish to install macOS without fear of boot troubles, you should remain on Clover. I have left the configs available as a reference. These configs are unchanged since I last used them. I have had zero complications or instability. 

OpenCore has proven to be quite good. I have not had any issues thus far. If you want to take a dive, go for it.
